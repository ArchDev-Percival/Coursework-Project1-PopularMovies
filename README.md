**Key Concepts Demonstrated:**

1. Effective use of `RecyclerView` & Handling UI Interaction handling on Lists implemented as Recycler Views
2. `Designing Utility Classes` to encapsulate:
  * URI building & Network API requests
  * Simple JSON Response Parsing
3. Use of the following `Standard External Libraries` to improve development and delivery timeline:
  * Picasso Library - Image downloading and caching library for Android
  * ButterKnife - Eliminating findViewByID calls and Resource lookups  
4. Building `Action Bar Menus` & Handling UI Interaction
5. App Navigation using Explicit & Implicit `Intents`
6. `Preserving App State` on Re-configuration / Rotation
7. `Responsive UI` - Optimizing Application Layouts on Regular & Large Tablets
8. Use of git for `Version Control` & Adhering to a `Consistent Git Style`
9. Consistency in adhereing to the `Java Coding standard` & The Udacity Java Coding Style
